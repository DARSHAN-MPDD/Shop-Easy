   - Use a reputable payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle payment processing.
   - Never store credit card information directly in your database.
   - Implement PCI DSS compliance for handling cardholder data.
3. **Anti-Fraud Features**:
   - Implement address verification (AVS) for credit card transactions.
   - Use 3D Secure authentication for credit card payments.
   - Monitor for suspicious activity and implement rate limiting.
4. **Authentication Security**:
   - Use strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for user passwords.
   - Implement secure session management with proper expiration.
   - Use CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.
5. **Data Validation**:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
